Issue Summary:
The entire duration of this outage was about 8 hours from the first occurance to the resolution.In this particular instance the incidence caused the whole companies internet speeds to slow to a hault and the entire building's VOIP phones to have noise quality issues and intermittently drop calls altogether. On the caller's end trying to reach any of the department's they were only intermittently having their calls answered, heard a busy tone or could hear a garbled voice before the calls dropped. As the issue progressed 100% of the users were effected; both the employee's phones and internet and the customers attempting to reach the support department via SMS or call. This issue was caused by two compounding problems; firstly the company had not properly accounted for the increased influx of calls that would occur with the increased customer base from their recent expansion. Secondly, since these phones were on a VOIP system that was not on a dedicated internet connection but hardwired into the same fiber connection it caused the employees internet connections to slow then hault completely. Any attempts at getting a dynamic LAN address were denied by rebooted phones/computers since the system froze.
